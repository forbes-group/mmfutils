    "The `ObjectBase` and `Object` classes provide some useful features described below. Consider a problem where a class is defined through a few parameters, but requires extensive initialization before it can be properly used.  An example is a numerical simulation where one passes the number of grid points $N$ and a length $L$, but the initialization must generate large grids for efficient use later on.  These grids should be generated before computations begin, but should not be re-generated every time needed.  They also should not be pickled when saved to disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deferred initialization via the `init()` method:** The idea here changes the semantics of `__init__()` slightly by deferring any expensive initialization to `init()`.  Under this scheme, `__init__()` should only set and check what we call picklable attributes: these are parameters that define the object (they will be pickled in `Object` below) and will be stored in a list `self.picklable_attributes` which is computed at the end of `ObjectBase.__init__()` as the list of all keys in `__dict__`.  Then, `ObjectBase.__init__()` will call `init()` where all remaining attributes should be calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows users to change various attributes, then reinitialize the object once with an explicit call to `init()` before performing expensive computations.  This is an alternative to providing complete properties (getters and setters) for objects that need to trigger computation.  The use of setters is safer, but requires more work on the side of the developer and can lead to complex code when different properties depend on each other.  The approach here puts all computations in a single place.  Of course, the user must remember to call `init()` before working with the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate this, we provide a mild check in the form of an `initialized` flag that is set to `True` at the end of the base `init()` chain, and set to `False` if any variables are in `pickleable_attributes` are set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Serialization and Deferred Initialization:**\n",
    "The base class `ObjectBase` does not provide any pickling services but does provide a nice representation.  Additional functionality is provided by `Object` which uses the features of `ObjectBase` to define `__getstate__()` and `__setstate__()` methods for pickling which pickle only the `picklable_attributes`.  Note: unpickling an object will **not** call `__init__()` but will call `init()` giving objects a chance to restore the computed attributes from pickles.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Note:** *Before using, consider if these features are really needed â€“ with all such added functionality comes additional potential failure modes from side-interactions. The `ObjectBase` class is quite simple, and therefore quite safe, while `Object` adds additional functionality with potential side-effects.  For example, a side-effect of support for pickles is that `copy.copy()` will also invoke `init()` when copying might instead be much faster.  Thus, we recommend only using `ObjectBase` for efficient code.*"
