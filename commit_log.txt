TST: Fixed test with python 3.12.

* Dicts are now ordered so the visual repr of OrderedDict has changed.
* It seems like the builtin sum() now does a stable sorted summation.  We use reduce to
  demonstrate bad behavior, but should maybe deprecate our sums.

TST,BUG: Tests pass (updated for new numpy).  Fixed issue with contourf rasterization.

* Fix doctest which fail because of new numpy repr (np.True_ etc.).  Explicitly
  print(), or call float().  See NEP 51.

* As of Matplotlib 3.8.0, the ContourSet collections changed, breaking the rasterization
  of contourf.  This is now fixed and slated for Deprecation.
